# Railway Tracking System

A real-time railway tracking system that allows users to track the location of trains, get estimated arrival times, and receive alerts for delays or cancellations.

## Features

- **Real-time Train Location**: Track the location of trains using GPS or station-based data.
- **Estimated Arrival Times**: Get real-time predictions on train arrival times.
- **Alerts**: Receive alerts for delays or cancellations.
- **Station-specific Data**: View detailed information about train schedules and stops.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Maps API
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, CORS
- **Real-time Data**: Fetch API for real-time train data

## Project Structure

```
RailwayTrackingSystem/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file for the user interface
├── styles.css        # CSS for styling the page
├── script.js         # JavaScript for handling real-time updates and map
├── server.js         # Node.js backend to serve train data
└── package.json      # Node.js dependencies and configurations
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/railway-tracking-system.git
   cd railway-tracking-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open the game**:
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser to start tracking the train.
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `script.js` file with your Google Maps API key.

## How it Works

- The map shows the current location of the train, which is fetched in real time from the backend every 10 seconds.
- Train details such as name, location, and estimated arrival time are displayed on the page.
- The backend (`server.js`) simulates the train movement and provides train data.

## Future Enhancements

- **Single-Player Mode**: Add AI-based prediction for arrival times.
- **Improved Styling**: Enhance the design and layout for better responsiveness.
- **Station Data Integration**: Connect with real-world APIs for live train schedules.
